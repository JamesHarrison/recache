= Recache
Recache is a transparent cache wrapper for Reve, the EVE Online Ruby API library by Lisa Seeyle.

While Reve is a fully Ruby-native library it has (since revision 47 or so) worked in place as a Rails plugin. Recache is a Rails plugin by design and requires Rails to work.
The cache method Recache uses is based on ActiveRecord and so will work with pretty much any database, including SQLite, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL and so on. All that is required is a Rails project.

=== Installing

To install Recache you just need to install the plugin and then generate a migration to build Recache's required tables.
 ruby script/plugin install http://code.talkunafraid.co.uk/recache/trunk
 ruby script/generate recache
 rake db:migrate
You can use the SVN externals method for keeping Recache up to date by adding the -x command line switch to the plugin install line.
You will need Reve installed to use Recache- if Reve is not installed, Recache will throw a ReveError exception.

= Example

Recache is transparent. All you need to do to take advantage of basic functionality is use the Recache module instead of Reve.
  Reve::API.new(userid,key)
  # goes to
  Recache::API.new(userid,key)

Returns should be identical to the Reve documented returns for a given function. All options you pass through Recache will be passed on to Reve.
